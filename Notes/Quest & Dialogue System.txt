So I've been brainstorming how to implement a quest/dialogue system
i really think we should pretty much copy bethesda in how they do it for the skyrim engine (rando fun fact, fallout 4 is the skyrim engine, just a bit updated! At least, thats what they say on the Fallout mod page)

from what i'm understanding so far from it, is were gonna need scripting in our game
i looked into a few ways to add scripting and not entirely sure what the best option is
	Javascript - no idea how javascript works/syntaxs/etc But, theres a project/plugin called UnrealJS - google it, it installs easy but i had no idea how to write/mess with the example JS
	
	SkookumScript - google it, again, theres a plugin on the marketplace. this looks suuuper promising, but suuper powerful. like too powerful. i dont think we need a shotgun creating extra overhang for us (i tried it out and it seems cool, but adds a lot of time to the startup process, and adds an extra window for its own IDE)
	
	LuaScript - this seems like the best option, its built in to the unreal engine source, we just have to download lua binaries (or python binaries, i think we could load any script language we want) thing here is connecting it to our own unreal engine classes, so like the JS, no idea where/how to start on that - check out (unreal engine program folder, so C/ProgramFiles/EpicGames/Unrealengine)/ Engine/Plugins/ScriptingGenerator/Lua i think, look around in there for it
	
Anyway, scripting is gonna be key because my idea (and how bethesda does it) is this kinda workflow:
		you make an actor to give you a quest
		you give that actor an id - SSTQ_Barry (Space Shooter Test Quest_Barry)
		then you make a quest
		in that quest you set up some dialogue
		hey would you find me my amulet?
		no
			do nothing
		yes
			run script
			
		the script would be: advanceQuestStage() or something like that, but the point is it would be entered in the editor

	you should check our their quest making tutorial, but while reading, pretend we have the same tools
	
	i think once we have an idea for how we want to "create" our quests, well know what classes we need to make, to make that happen
	
	anyway, this is hard to explain over text, some of the ideas i have so far haha
