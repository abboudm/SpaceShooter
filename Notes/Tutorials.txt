Unreal Documentation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Gameplay/index.html 	
		-Gameplay/Framework. Good starting point into the unreal docs, specifically the Framework tab. Also lookup AActor and UObject, those are crucial to understand most any object

https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/index.html
		-Programming guide, basic hub to find programming related pages
		-check out/explore:
			UObject
			AActor 		-also naming conventions: A - actor, U, object, E, Enum, I interface, F struct, etc etc, this is crucial, as project wont build if not using conventions
			Delagates 	-used to call events/functions from other classes, you have to bind a delagate to a function
			TArray/TMap 	-unreals array class
			Structs		-yeah yeah, structs are structs, but check out unreals documentation for it / look at our source code to get an idea, the crucial part here is...
			MACROS		-these are things like UFUNCTION() UPROPERTY() UCLASS() UENUM() and more; these are Unreal Magic functions (haha) it does magic to make the code work!
			Reflection System	-related to macros, the reflection system is very important  - one example is this is how blueprints can use c++ data types/objects

https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Resources/SampleGames/index.html
		-Holy grail of source code
		-each one of these projects (which you download in the unreal launcher, just search for Shooter Game or w/e) has:
			-source code
			-assetts
		that are FREE to use in commercial games! 
	Speaking of which, the biggest tradeoff to developing with unreal, is that if your project starts making money, unreal gets a percentage of it (i dont care, if this gets to the point where we make serious money, that is gonna be way beyond my expected goals)

	Anyway, Most of my weapon code + UI code is from the Shooter Game project
	if you download one of these projects:
		go to the directory
		right click the project file
		generate visual studio files, and bam, now you got a ShooterGame.sln


//---------These pages are in the Wiki, under category CODE, so start there for super specifc topics, like a save system or how to make a projectile
https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Category:Code
		Tutorials using c++ for various systems/gameplay stuff, check em out!

https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Save_System,_Read_%26_Write_Any_Data_to_Compressed_Binary_Files
		Author: Rama - this guy is insane, he has a toooon of tutorials, mostly c++, but also a ton of blueprint plugins
		C++ tutorial on saving data - this is gonna be super crucial, as it will take care of
			-saving games/loading games/game menu stuff/settings
			-saving level objects - dynamic world. so if you drop an item in a room, it will stay there next time we load the lvl
			-persistant user data - keeping inventory and other data structs in tact between loading lvls

https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Custom_Character_Movement_Component
		Title, should be good. Havnt read thru this since ClimbingMovement took care of this!


honestly, just explore the unreal engine docs, theres a LOT

but if you want to explore a more specific topic, and its not obvious where to start (cause i was there for a few topics like the reflection system)
let me know, and i'll either tell you the unreal related name, or we'll research it together, haha

https://github.com/tomlooman/EpicSurvivalGameSerie://github.com/tomlooman/EpicSurvivalGameSeries
		Here is where a lot of other code was inspired from: this has a lot of working stuff
		i think its made by an epic employee, but its not an official sample project. or maybe it is, idk, found it thru github
		essentially, i copied all of this project's textures/materials/particle effects, to use in our project- but some are wonky - specifically the pistol muzzle flash!
		this is a good project to lookaround in and see how everything fits in a complete project
		other aspect is this is a c++/blueprints project, which is the type of project were making!


https://github.com/Deema35/Climbing-Movement-Component
		Climbing Component that were using. Mine however is slightly edited, replaced russian velocyity/stupid spelling. End game is to write our own version of this, not just copying this guys stuff

https://github.com/artemavrin/UE4-DialogueSystem
		this is the github i copied the DialogueSystem folder from. again, another good example to look around, but were not gonna do this kind of implementation
		actually, thats a TODO, which is delete our DialogueSystem folder & code

https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?80021-Free-Community-Assets
		FREE ASSETS - i got the pistol/some gun meshes from here

https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Quest_Framework
		Quest framework, super simple, might not be needed, but could help with ideas for other systems

MindlessPursuits Youtube - these aren't too important, as its all in blueprints, but this guy did a good job teaching basic game concepts, recommended but not necessary to watch
	https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4g86nVHyAEca_lA88sXaJX58hI78sekA
		I watched basic pickups / ai, but i forget how different the video is to how i'm doing it, should be pretty similar core ideas tho.
	https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4g86nVHyAEeqgu0MT0ZVZJ86svftAMjr
		I went through this whole playlist when making the blueprint only project i have (which btw, i can send you so you can see how i did stuff)
